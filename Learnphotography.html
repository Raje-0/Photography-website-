          <h5 class="card-title">What is photography?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">A simple definition of photography is that it is the process of capturing light with a device known as a camera and creating an image. That camera could come in various forms by a modern interpretation, including cell phone cameras, digital cameras, and traditional analog cameras.Photography can serve many purposes and have many facets. Photography can tell a story, it can capture a moment in time, it can document, and it can be art. There are many technical uses for photography as well as social and creative ones. How we use and interact with photography is highly personal and will differ from one person to the next.</p>

      <div class="col-md-7">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sutter Speed <span class="text-muted">the nominal time for which a shutter is open at a given setting.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">A camera takes a photograph by exposing a digital sensor (or a piece of film) to light. The shutter is simply a barrier that keeps light out when you’re not taking a photo. Pressing the button at the top of the camera (it’s actually called the shutter release) opens the shutter, and when the shutter is open, an image is recorded. When the shutter closes, the camera stops recording.

            The shutter speed, then, is just how long that barrier stays open to let light into the image. Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes.
            
            As one of three elements that affect how light or dark an image is (called exposure), understanding shutter speed is essential to taking full creative control of the camera. If the shutter is left open for a long time, the lens will let in a lot of light, and unless you are shooting a very dark scene, the image will be too bright, or overexposed. If the shutter speed is too quick, on the other hand, the photograph will be too dark.
            
            So what’s the right shutter speed? That depends on how much light is in the scene. Outdoors on a sunny day, you’ll need a quick shutter speed, like 1/500. Indoors, you’ll need to slow it down a bit — perhaps 1/100..</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Aperture <span class="text-muted"> controls the amount of light that enters your camera..</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The way that photos are created is reliant on an “exposure triangle” controlled by three major settings. Shutter speed controls how fast or slow your shutter closes, affecting the time of your exposure and helping you freeze motion properly. ISO is used to indicate the light sensitivity of film or adjust the light sensitivity of a digital camera’s sensor and photographers adjust it based on their surroundings. Lastly,

            Aperture is the adjustable lens opening that controls the amount of light allowed into the camera. Learning to properly adjust these three settings based on your location and subject is essential for capturing good exposures.</p>

          <p class="lead">ISO is your camera’s sensitivity to light as it pertains to either film or a digital sensor. A lower ISO value means less sensitivity to light, while a higher ISO means more sensitivity. It’s one element of photography’s exposure triangle — along with aperture and shutter speed — and plays an essential role in the quality of your photos.</p>
